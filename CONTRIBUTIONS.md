## Improving the docs

We welcome you to improve our documentation. Our current documentation is found [here](https://github.com/vbackend/visual-backend/tree/main/docs)

Everything is written in Markdown. To contribute to the documentation, simply fork & clone the repo, open a new branch and edit the documentation (under the docs folder), then commit your changes and make a pull request.

Feel free to add documentation for a new section, but think about opening an issue first to discuss whether the new section will be accepted, before working on it.

## Building new modules for Visual Backend

We very much welcome our community to create new modules on top of the existing ones at Visual Backend. However, at the moment, we are still developing a streamlined way to do so, and will implement this feature soon.

**When reporting a bug, please describe as clearly as possible:**
